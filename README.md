# QuantumSignals cBot

A sophisticated multi-timeframe trading algorithm for cTrader that combines technical indicators with advanced risk management and volatility filtering.

## üöÄ Overview

QuantumSignals is an automated trading robot (cBot) that uses a confluence of three powerful technical indicators across multiple timeframes to generate high-probability trading signals. The strategy incorporates ATR-based volatility filtering and dynamic risk management to adapt to changing market conditions.

## üìä Trading Logic

### Core Strategy
The bot uses a **three-pillar approach** for signal generation:

1. **Bollinger Bands** - Identifies mean reversion opportunities
   - **Buy Signal**: Price touches or penetrates lower band (oversold conditions)
   - **Sell Signal**: Price touches or penetrates upper band (overbought conditions)

2. **MACD Crossover** - Confirms momentum direction
   - **Buy Signal**: MACD crosses above signal line with signal below threshold
   - **Sell Signal**: MACD crosses below signal line with signal above threshold

3. **Stochastic Oscillator** - Validates entry timing
   - **Buy Signal**: %K crosses above %D from oversold territory (<20)
   - **Sell Signal**: %K crosses below %D from overbought territory (>80)

### Signal Confluence
**All three conditions must align** for a trade signal to be generated, ensuring high-probability setups.

## üéØ Key Features

### Trade Direction Control
- **Both**: Allow long and short trades (default)
- **Long Only**: Buy trades only
- **Short Only**: Sell trades only  
- **Disabled**: No trading (useful for analysis/maintenance)

### ATR Volatility Filtering
- **Volatility Range Filter**: Only trades when ATR is within specified multiples of average
- **Dynamic Stop Loss/Take Profit**: Automatically adjusts SL/TP based on market volatility
- **Market Adaptation**: Wider stops in volatile markets, tighter in calm conditions

### Advanced Risk Management
- **Trailing Stop Loss**: Protects profits as trades move favorably
- **Break-Even Stop**: Moves stop to entry + buffer after specified profit
- **Trade Cooldown**: Prevents overtrading with configurable time delays
- **Spread Protection**: Blocks trades during wide spread conditions
- **Position Sizing**: Configurable lot sizes with proper volume normalization

## üìã Parameters

### Trade Control
- **Trade Direction**: Control allowed trade types (Both/Long Only/Short Only/Disabled)

### ATR Settings
- **Enable ATR Filter**: Toggle volatility-based trade filtering
- **ATR Periods**: Calculation period for Average True Range (default: 14)
- **Min/Max ATR Multiplier**: Acceptable volatility range (1.0x - 3.0x)
- **Dynamic SL/TP**: Use ATR-based stops instead of fixed pips
- **SL/TP ATR Multipliers**: Stop loss and take profit as ATR multiples

### Protection
- **Trade Cooldown**: Minimum minutes between trades (default: 15)
- **Quantity**: Trade size in lots (default: 0.01)
- **Stop Loss/Take Profit**: Fixed pip values (overridden if dynamic enabled)
- **Max Spread**: Maximum allowed spread for trade execution

### Indicator Settings
Independent configuration for buy and sell signals:
- **Bollinger Bands**: Periods, standard deviation, MA type, timeframe
- **MACD**: Long/short cycles, signal periods, thresholds, timeframe  
- **Stochastic**: %K/%D periods, slowing, MA type, levels, timeframe

## üîß Installation

1. Download the `QuantumSignals.cs` file
2. Open cTrader and navigate to Automate ‚Üí cBots
3. Click "Add cBot" and select the downloaded file
4. Build the project (Ctrl+Shift+B)
5. Configure parameters and start trading

## üìà Usage Recommendations

### Market Conditions
- **Trending Markets**: Use "Long Only" in uptrends, "Short Only" in downtrends
- **Ranging Markets**: Use "Both" for mean reversion opportunities
- **High Volatility**: Increase ATR max multiplier, use dynamic SL/TP
- **Low Volatility**: Decrease ATR min multiplier, consider tighter stops

### Optimization Tips
- Test different timeframe combinations for each indicator
- Optimize ATR multipliers for your specific market/timeframe
- Adjust cooldown periods based on market speed
- Compare performance with/without ATR filtering

### Risk Management
- Always use appropriate position sizing
- Monitor drawdown and adjust parameters accordingly
- Consider market sessions and news events
- Regular backtesting on different market periods
